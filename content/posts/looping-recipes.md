I recently bought a Line 6 HX Stomp as a gift to myself. One of my favorite features on the pedal is that it has a built in looper. So after playing around with it for several weeks, I've made some passable sounds from it.

**tldr;** `chord progression + bass line + percussion + good timing = cool sounds`

## Percussion

The percussion part of the loop is what holds the beat together. On the guitar, this is going to be plucking/hitting/slapping/etc on muted strings. While this seems limiting, people have come up with some very cool ways to emulate sound (google Seiji Igusa for some great examples).

A simple beat on the drums might look like this:
```
HH |x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-|| high-hat
 S |----o-------o---|| snare
 B |o-------o-------|| bass drum
    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +
```

On a guitar, we can emulate these drums by playing the strings in specific ways:

```
    HH   B    S
e |-x--|----|-x--||
b |-x--|----|-x--||
g |----|----|-x--||
d |----|----|-x--||
a |----|----|-x--||
E |----|-x--|-x--||
              * - slapping
```
Note: You don't have to hit all of the strings, as long as the slap sounds great!

## Chord Progression
